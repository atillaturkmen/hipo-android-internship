## Packages
I have used the MVVM architecture for the app. You can find explanation about each package below:

- data: Holds the data in hipo.json file and my information that will be added.
- model: Models that are used for storing the data
- theme: Colors, themes and font types used in the app. This folder is automatically generated by Android Studio. I only added extra colors I used.
- view: Composable functions that are used in main activity.
- viewmodel: Holds the mutable live data initally taken from data package.

## Layout
I have used Jetpack Compose library to make the layout. There is a scaffold with a top bar that holds "Members" text. "Add New Member" button is a floating action button in the scaffold.
Everything else is structured in columns.
